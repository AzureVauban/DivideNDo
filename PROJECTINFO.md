# Project Name: Divide&Do

<h2 style="color:#2E8B57;">Description:</h2>

Chores can be such as hassle to delegate. Whose turn is it to wash dishes, whose turn to take out the trash, who was supposed to clean the bathroom. All arguments, resolved with this one app: <strong>Divide&amp;Do</strong> ends the debating of who does what, by allowing you or a group of people to assign and rotate chores automatically.

The main goal of the mobile app is to solve the problems of roommates and families arguing about chores.
